# INTRO  !!!!!!!!


Welcome to Auction Site. Now originally it was going to be named "WebsiteForMoneyH" But then I realized it sounded unproffessional and went with a more simplistic "Auction Site"

# Design:
Now then Design I did struggle through it a lot. 
However, my main design was from a website I saw long time ago in the 2010's. That had a very retro + Futuristic style in it. 
It was a lot of back and fourth, but the style was "blue sky new york" I can't exactly explain it properly but it was simplistic
mostly empty, and enjoyable to be in. So That's what I mainly went for.
Sadly, I did not go to my expected values. Will have to work more in the future.


# JS
Very difficult.

# HTML
HTML was more or less simplistic, as more it really felt like I was writing more HTML in JS then HTML itself.
